# AdventOfCode2020
This code-base contains a collection of Swift solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)<sup>1</sup> 2020. These are my personal solutions and have not neccesarily been fully optimized.

## Get Involved
I encourage everyone to participate in Advent of Code. If you'd like, you can join a private leaderboard of my peers (join code: `1048725-41c081f6`). Once the leaderboard's spots have been filled, I'll remove this section of the readme. At the end of the month, I'll post the top 5 people on the leaderboard.

**NOTE:** *The leaderboard is retro-active, so if you've already done the days leading up to the day you join, your points will still count.*
